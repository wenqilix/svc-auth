  Svc Auth-->>API: Issue new access token thru response headers
  API->>API: Set refreshed access token to HttpOnly Cookie
```

### Services YAML Configuaration

For each service that need to interface with `SVC-AUTH` for a valid JWT token, create a yaml configuration file in `resources/services` directory
Each file should contain the guid identifier to the service, public key to decode and verify signature sent by the service and the payload to insert into the returned JWT token

```
// Arbitrary identifier to locate yaml configuration file of requesting service
guid: ...
// public rsa key to verify signature sent by requesting service
public-key: ...
// As required by service. Can be anything. The payload will be inserted in the issued JWT as it is
payload:
  // Sample payload content
  userId: api-mailer
  authorization:
    - id: '*'
      scopes:
        - jobalert:read
```


#### `How to convert RSA private key to pcks8 format`
```bash
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -in private_key.pem -out private_key_pkcs8.pem -nocrypt
```

#### `Creating new asymmetric key pairs for new services`
Generate private key:
```bash
  openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private_key.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:512
```
Generate public key using the private key:
```bash
  openssl rsa -pubout -in private_key.pem -out public_key.pem
```

### Operating This

#### Monitoring & Metrics

The Springboot Actuator is used to provide the `/actuator/health` and `/actuator/prometheus` endpoints for healthckeck and Prometheus metrics respectively.

Configuration of both endpoints **require both enabling and exposing** and this is done via the `management.endpoint.*.enabled` and `management.endpoints.web.exposure.include` configurations in `application.yml`.
